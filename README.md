# Product-Classification
To build a machine learning model that predicts the product category based on the given input features, we can follow these general steps:
Collect and preprocess the data: Obtain the dataset containing the variables described above, and preprocess it to ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and relevant. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset using statistical methods and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or relationships between the variables. This will help to choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem.

Feature engineering & Feature Selection: It involves creating new features or transforming existing features to better represent the underlying data. Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features to reduce the dimensionality of the data. These two combinely improves model performance, and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Split the data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Choose a machine learning algorithm: It involves selection of an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem and the characteristics of the dataset. For example, we could use a decision tree, logistic regression, or a neural network.

Train the model: Train the machine learning model using the training dataset.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning model using the testing dataset. Use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the performance.

Tune the model: If the performance of the model is not satisfactory, we can tune the hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithm to improve its performance.

Deploy the model: Once the machine learning model has been trained and evaluated, we can deploy it in a production environment to classify raw materials received from vendors.
